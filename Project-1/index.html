        <h1>Some Basketball types to follow.</h1>
        <p>One way is to find your shot earlier then you want to. Another one is to always hold your follow through after you shoot the ball. Those are just some ways to improve your shoot. For dribbling you need to keep your eyes up and dont look at the basketball when you are playing. Also for dribbling is that you should use your finger tips while dribbling and not your whole palm.</p>
